# Oceanic Minimal

![alt text](/screenshot.png "Screenshot of these settings in use in Visual Studio Code")

Minimal VS Code settings that strip back and tweak the [Oceanic Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marcoms.oceanic-plus) theme, which in turn was inspired by the OG [Oceanic Next](https://labs.voronianski.com/oceanic-next-color-scheme/).

**Note:** this is not an actual theme extension... yet. Since I'm always making tweaks to my settings, I just wanted a way to keep things in sync across my machines.

## Steps

If you like the look of this, you can follow these steps:

1.  Install and set your theme to [Oceanic Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marcoms.oceanic-plus) (this will look especially nice if you're using a font with italics support like [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) or [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/))
2.  Go to **Preferences > Settings** (`âŒ˜,`) and paste the content of the `settings` file in your User Settings
3.  _Optional:_ install the [file-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=file-icons.file-icons) extension and set your file icon theme to "File Icons (Colorless)"
